  We have now been on a ride through some of the interesting parts of
  functional programming. You have seen some code that doesn't look much like
  the JavaScript we normally write. We have also seen that the same code has
  interesting properties, such as less focus on state and mutability.
  Hopefully you have learned something along the way.

  To wrap up what we have seen today -- basically, functional programming
  achieve reuse at a coarser-grained level than object-oriented programming,
  extracting common machinery with parameterized behavior. Most applications
  do things with lists of elements, so a functional approach is to build reuse
  mechanisms around the idea of lists plus contextualized, portable code.

  Btw, want to learn more?
